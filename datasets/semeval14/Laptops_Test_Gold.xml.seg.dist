the apple engineers have not yet discovered the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
made $T$ -lrb- part of my business -rrb- very difficult to maintain .
2.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the mac mini is $T$ just right .

3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 
only problem that i had was that the $T$ was not very good for me , i only had a problem once or twice with it , but probably my computer was a bit defective .
4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 
it is super fast and has outstanding $T$ .
3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
but the $T$ is just too slow .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
strong build though which really adds to its $T$ .
4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
strong $T$ though which really adds to its durability .
1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 
the $T$ is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it $T$ perfectly .

the $T$ is very longer .
1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
its $T$ is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
its size is ideal and the $T$ is acceptable .

2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 
it 's not inexpensive but the $T$ is impressive for a computer this small .
3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0

biggest complaint is $T$ .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
only 2 $T$ ... seems kind of ... limited .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
it has all the expected $T$ and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .

amazing $T$ for anything i throw at it .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 
the receiver was full of superlatives for the $T$ and performance .

8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 7.0 
i was extremely happy with the $T$ itself .
4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 
the new mbp offers great $T$ and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 2.0

8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had $T$ 
2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 
 $T$ is wonderful , well worth it .
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
but the $T$ of mac mini is a huge disappointment .

0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0

4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0

2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0

my wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not $T$ as it should .
5.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0

 $T$ is a mixed bag .
0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 
it suddenly can not $T$ .
1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 
 $T$ was in poor condition , had to replace it .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 
the $T$ is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 
my only complaint is the total lack of $T$ that come with the mac mini .

the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be $T$ , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .

 $T$ is bright and gorgeous .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 
the only solution is to turn the $T$ down , etc. .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the $T$ .

3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
it is fast and easy to $T$ .
2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 
and the fact that it comes with an $T$ definitely speeds things up
5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 
i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its $T$ are a great help

5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0

my last laptop was a 17 '' asus gaming machine , which $T$ admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .

not sure on $T$ .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
my one complaint is that there was no $T$ .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
this newer netbook has no $T$ or network lights .

i was having a though time deciding between the 13 '' macbook air or the macbook pro 13 '' -lrb- both baseline models , $T$ at 1,200 $ retail -rrb-

not too expense and has enough $T$ for most users and many ports .
3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many $T$ .
6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 6.0 
the $T$ is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .

3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
i was given a demonstration of $T$ .
4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful $T$ .
4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 
i thought that it will be fine , if i do some $T$ .
4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
 $T$ very smoothly .
0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 
 $T$ slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .
0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 
boot-up slowed significantly after all $T$ were installed .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
more likely it will require replacing the $T$ once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
