a month or so ago , the freaking $T$ just died .
4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
the $T$ it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
then after 4 or so months the $T$ stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .

the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like $T$ .
7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0

2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0

3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0

also , if you need to talk to a $T$ , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .

4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
the $T$ is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 2.0

the $T$ said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 
the $T$ i purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .

the $T$ is bright and the keyboard is nice ;

high $T$ , however .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 
i thought learning the $T$ would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc .
3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 4.0 
i had static in the output , and i had to reduce the $T$ to `` fm '' as opposed to the default `` cd .

i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the $T$ due to his accent .

it is easy to $T$ and lightweight .

while apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their $T$ is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .

that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable $T$ which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .

10.0 10.0 9.0 11.0 11.0 10.0 10.0 11.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 
the $T$ is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .
1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the $T$ , but i got used to them .
4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 
not to mention , the $T$ is absolutely amazing .
3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
 $T$ also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 
not using $T$ not sure what thats about .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 
now for the $T$ problems .
3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the $T$ and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
8.0 8.0 7.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 7.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 8.0 
it 's fast and has excellent $T$ .
3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
 $T$ included .
0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 
features like the $T$ are very block-like and old school .
2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 
 $T$ like the font are very block-like and old school .
0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 
it is loaded with $T$ that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 
it is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it $T$ way to slow .
3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different $T$ would come off of it .
5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 
finally , i should note that i took the $T$ from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .
4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 
 $T$ is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $ 100 to get $T$ .
4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 10.0 9.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 10.0 11.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the $T$ is horrible .
3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
then on top of it all their $T$ is in the middle east .
2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 
the only bad part is the $T$ / weight .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
the only bad part is the size / $T$ .
4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
the little $T$ that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 
i liked the $T$ .
2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
its good for playing my apps on facebook or $T$ .
6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 
its good for $T$ my apps on facebook or watching movies .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 
from the $T$ to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 
from the build quality to the $T$ , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 
i love the $T$ where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular $T$ , and the program will simply open that file .

pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops $T$ out of no were .
5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0

3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0

2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0

2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 
a coupla months later , they change my $T$ .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0

pc never worked right even after $T$ fixed .
3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek $T$ and promise of less tech issues .

my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible $T$ , but this machine just caused another plunge .

for the $T$ to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .
2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0

it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for $T$ and i have to accept the outcome .
5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 4.0

oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a $T$ so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 20.5 20.5 20.5 20.5 20.5 20.5 20.5 20.5

17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 17.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 
the only thing that i have , is the $T$ is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .

i 'm still within the one year $T$ but the repair `` depot '' has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .

but i needed a laptop for $T$ .
4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic $T$ .

i would like at least a 4 hr . $T$ .

long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop $T$ for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .

another thing is that after only a month the $T$ broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .

my main reason to convert was the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
it has a faster $T$ and more ram .

it has a faster processor and more $T$ .
3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0

if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find $T$ , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .

3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 2.0 
comfterbale to $T$ light easy to transport .
1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
comfterbale to use light easy to $T$ .
2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
the computer itself is a good product but the $T$ stinks .
4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 
i thought the $T$ was great for the specs .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 
i thought the price was great for the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 5.0 
the only down fall is that it has no $T$ but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 
so , the $T$ really does n't matter to me .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 
 $T$ stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the $T$ .
6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 6.0 
everything from the $T$ to the os is simple and to the point .
2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 
everything from the design to the $T$ is simple and to the point .
4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 
i ' v spent as much for $T$ as i would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 3.0 
i personally like the $T$ but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 3.0 
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered $T$ while still looking professional in front of my customers .
4.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 
this just keeps having it 's $T$ replaced !
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher $T$ .
5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
the only downfall is the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
very fast $T$ and shut down .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 
very fast boot up and $T$ .
3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right $T$ for what i need it .
3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
if $T$ is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card .
2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a $T$ .
5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
i had read online that some users were having $T$ problems .
4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 
my last computer , a toshiba , $T$ only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 
it $T$ too quickly .
1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 
but to be honest , the $T$ issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time .
4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 
then it ceased $T$ at all .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a $T$ however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0

2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have $T$ as an antiviral program .

the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my $T$ was up and hung up on me .

wonderful sleek $T$ is only on the outside .
1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0

4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 
maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the $T$ has simply gone black .

now the $T$ is going darker , darker , darker .
2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
either the computer is too slow to detect the $T$ typed -lrb- this is unlikely as i am a slow typist -rrb- or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys being typed .

when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the $T$ is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 
i sent it back and found this time that the $T$ was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .

i previously purchased a 13 '' macbook -lrb- had pro specs and was $T$ -rrb- which had a nvidia 9800 -lrb- if i am not mistaken -rrb- and it had major heating issues .

the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new $T$ and they did n't even request for a receipt .
4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0

4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
the only thing is that the $T$ wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
the first fell apart right after the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old $T$ which works good .
30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 
the $T$ has a wonderful nature feel .
1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
they went through asking me open up various components , taking $T$ out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0

the $T$ does n't last long but i 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .

i was looking too closely at the other $T$ and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features were standard .
3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0

i have no idea how this could have even gotten past $T$ during production .

i bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the $T$ stopped responding .
7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 
oh yea , has no $T$ on the side .
2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
the $T$ soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .

but the $T$ is torn after one use .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 
the $T$ is amazing .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the $T$ just `` slide '' downwards .
4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0

it is known as $T$ , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .

 $T$ is a nightmare .
0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 
the $T$ came with the computer and works beautifully .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 
the $T$ forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .

i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing $T$ and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me -lrb- even after installing new browsers -rrb- then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it .

the so called laptop $T$ to slow and i hate it !
1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
 $T$ seems large for this class of computer .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 
i dislike the quality and the placement of the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 5.0 
the $T$ and clarity , and sharpness are great .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
the screen graphics and $T$ , and sharpness are great .

the screen graphics and clarity , and $T$ are great .
2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
so i called $T$ -lrb- which is good too -rrb- and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 
so i called customer support -lrb- which is good too -rrb- and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect $T$ at all , i just chose to hide the message .
5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 6.0

the $T$ is edgy and durable .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 
stopped $T$ less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0

5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 4.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 
but , for the $T$ this is a winner .
3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
later it held zero $T$ and its replacement worked for less than three months .
2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 
also , the $T$ does not last very long at all .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
i bought it from hsn because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that $T$ just crashes it more often ...
4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 
i looked around and based off my $T$ / features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .
6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 6.0

the $T$ gets so hot it is scary .
1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old $T$ .
4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0

3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced $T$ .

getting the $T$ is a must .
1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the $T$ .

the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the $T$ that were on my pc .

it just $T$ flawlessly !

a key contributor that led me to mac is the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
eventually my $T$ would n't charge , so unless i had it plugged in it would n't even power on .

i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial $T$ you 'll find that they 're worth every penny -lrb- besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers -rrb- .

i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of $T$ and that is not the issue .
5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0

i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that $T$ .
4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
of course , for a student , $T$ is always an issue .
2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
now $T$ is broken , have to wait for a new one .
2.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 
the $T$ difference is next to nothing for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .
2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0

2 . the $T$ is low quality .
2.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
they also use two totally different $T$ .
2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 
they are about the same size $T$ .
2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the $T$ are less than satisfactory .
5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 
they offer the best $T$ in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .
2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 
the only problems are the $T$ isnt very loud i have to wear headphones .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0

3.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new $T$ , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .
9.0 10.0 12.0 11.0 8.0 9.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 8.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 9.0

3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
you know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are $T$ or working with photos .
3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 
there are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a $T$ computer .
7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 7.0 
to be honest i think it was faulty $T$ or something but idk .
4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 
i also love the small , convenient $T$ of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 2.0

while about 8 years ago , i hope that the $T$ has changed .
3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 
the difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the $T$ , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .
5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 4.0

- i propose that i can just swap the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
the $T$ holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .

 $T$ is limited though .
0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of $T$ and long battery life .

the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for $T$ requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 
the keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a $T$ , now looks terrible .
7.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 8.0 
the $T$ is awesome .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 5.0 
the $T$ is like no other laptop keyboard .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 
the keyboard is like no other laptop $T$ .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 
- computer crashed frequently and $T$ decreased very quickly .
4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
- i propose that they can just swap the $T$ .
3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
every $T$ on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload .
1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 
every driver on the $T$ is everything you will need for a reload .
5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 
i called their $T$ as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 2.0 
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the $T$ .

it 's also fairly easy to use the $T$ .
3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up $T$ $ 350 more than my original mac .
3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
so having the $T$ go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .
4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 
 $T$ is good for the price .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 
peformance is good for the $T$ .
4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of $T$ choosen by toshiba .
8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 7.0 
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad $T$ and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 
i had 3 months when the $T$ started going out .
3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
the improvements to the $T$ s have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 
it is super easy to $T$ .
3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
many of my classmates computers $T$ crashed .
2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 
ease of $T$ is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 9.0 4.0 
i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run $T$ , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .

in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they `` expedited '' the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a `` $T$ '' .

4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large $T$ and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .

disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable $T$ 
3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst $T$ possible .
4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0

hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the $T$ .
3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
it was not clear that the $T$ that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .

2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
good for $T$ and web browsing .
3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 4.0 
also , i have had alot of trouble with the $T$ sticking and will not type correctly .

excellent $T$ and well equipped .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 
this process continued to repeat itself until the $T$ had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .
5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0

without a doubt , the * $T$ * of this laptop is fantastic .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 
i could n't believe how long the $T$ lasted on a single charge .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single $T$ .
4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any $T$ left .
4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent $T$ capabilities .
12.0 13.0 14.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 11.0 12.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 9.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 10.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
but the biggest pain is that $T$ is not available 24/7 .
3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 
the $T$ are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large $T$ big enough to please anyone .
7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 7.0 
the most recent being that my $T$ is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox instead .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0

everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to $T$ .
4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
i know what 7 hrs of $T$ looks like .
5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 
i did not have to call the $T$ at all .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the $T$ and not the full windows 7 .
7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 6.0

the first problem is that the $T$ is simply unsatisfactory .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 
the $T$ randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 
 $T$ is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 11.0 11.0 10.0

3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 3.0 
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more $T$ and hard drive space .
4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 3.0

5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the $T$ ca n't be used with the ibook .
3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0

seems like maybe a bad $T$ from toshiba .
2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 
 $T$ is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .

first the $T$ goes completely out .
2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
i 'm learning the finger options for the $T$ that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0

i had to pay for the $T$ !
4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 
it bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic $T$ .
3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 
i took 3-4 years researching brands and $T$ of laptops .
3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 
we researched and found the best $T$ at macconnection .
3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 
but guess what ? -lrb- you have to buy an $T$ it does n't have a built in type -rrb- the notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .

so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful $T$ so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
5.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 
my friend just had to replace his entire $T$ , so did my wife , and it looks like i will have to as well .
4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 
 $T$ will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .

the $T$ also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 3.0 
the $T$ are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .

the ease of $T$ was terrific .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 4.0 4.0

the $T$ is probably an hour at best .

this is a review of $T$ .
4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the $T$ at the top .
4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the $T$ again and shut down and would not turn back on .

6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 6.0 
 $T$ is perfect for portable use in any environment .
0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 
first , it does not have a $T$ to open the lid .
2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0

i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old $T$ with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working -lrb- this was a rock star 7 years ago -rrb- .

i now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a $T$ laptop .
5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 
-rrb- and printing from either $T$ is an adventure .
4.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special $T$ to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .

another $T$ that is laughable is the chess game .
1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 
yes , i thought the $T$ was a little much , but i now realize you get what you pay for .

1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its $T$ ;
2.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough $T$ to get everything done .

3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 
the $T$ that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .

there are no gold key numbers too intall $T$ , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .

the $T$ has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to $T$ than most i have tried .

so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under $T$ .
9.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 12.0 11.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 8.0 
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't $T$ .

the $T$ is way way way to sensitve .

the $T$ is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .

after way too many times sending the thing in for repairs -lrb- $T$ was slow , and without the laptop i had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when i might hope to see my computer again -rrb- , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .

they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding $T$ , they do n't exist .

i guess he was the $T$ .
3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 
a seventy dollar $T$ !
1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 
the repairs were made quickly though i must say , however the second time they $T$ it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .

the $T$ are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .
1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair -lrb- the $T$ of a new one -rrb- .

took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse $T$ in the world .
1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 
then after 4 or so months the $T$ stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .

as usual at $T$ , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague -lrb- i could see them -rrb- .

the $T$ gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .

you ca n't even get a $T$ which is why i bought to begin with .

long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the $T$ and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .

in all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal $T$ laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .

4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 5.0
